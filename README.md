# Advent of code 2023

## To run

### With real inputs
Create a file `.session` containing [your advent of code session token](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) in the format:
```
session=<session_token_here>
```

Run with `cargo run`. If you want to run a specific day use `cargo run -- d<day>` (`d0` runs all days).

### With test inputs
These are generally the inputs used as an example when the puzzle is set, this can be ran using `cargo run -- d0 test` (or `d<day>` for a specific day)
